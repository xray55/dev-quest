## 🤔 What Is This?

**DEV//QUEST** is a free, self-paced coding academy that takes you from "I've never used a computer" to "I can build production applications." 

Unlike traditional courses, this platform uses **AI agents to generate lessons in real-time**, meaning the content is always evolving and improving. You learn by doing—every lesson includes interactive labs, coding challenges, and guided projects.

The AI continuously generates new lessons following a predefined curriculum roadmap, with each lesson including theory, analogies, code examples, interactive simulations, and assessment criteria.
