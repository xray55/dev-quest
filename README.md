⚡ DEV//QUEST: Autonomous AI Learning Academy

    An infinite, self expanding coding curriculum generated 24/7 by autonomous AI agents.

DEV//QUEST is a fully automated learning platform. Unlike traditional courses that are static, this academy is run by a fleet of AI agents (CrewAI) running inside a Docker container. They research topics, write code examples, verify accuracy, and publish new modules to the web automatically every day.
🚀 Features

    🧠 Dual-Brain Architecture:

        Standard Tracks: Uses qwen2.5-coder for Python, Web Dev, and DevOps.

        Security Tracks: Uses deepseek-r1-abliterated for uncensored Red Teaming, Malware Analysis, and Reverse Engineering.

    🎓 The "Dean" System: An intelligent agent reviews every lesson. It will reject incomplete lessons and demand specific follow up topics to ensure mastery.

    🔄 Producer-Publisher Workflow:

        The Factory: A Docker container runs 24/7, generating lessons into a local SQLite database.

        The Publisher: A Python script wakes up daily, snapshots the database, and pushes a static version to GitHub Pages.

    💻 In-Browser IDE: Run Python (via Pyodide) and HTML/JS code directly in the lesson interface.
