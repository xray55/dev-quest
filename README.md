## 🧬 The Recursive AI Difference

**DEVQUEST Academy** is not a static course. It is powered by a **Recursive AI Engine** that builds a personalized curriculum in real-time.

1.  **Infinite Depth:** If a concept is too complex, the AI recursively breaks it down into sub-lessons (`01a`, `01b`) until it is atomic and understandable.
2.  **Specialized Models:**
    * **Coding:** Uses `Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B` for high-precision engineering lessons.
    * **Security:** Uses `Qwen 3 Abliterated` for **uncensored** Red Team training (no "I cannot assist" refusals).
3.  **Polyglot Curriculum:** Covers everything from Low-Level C/Rust to High-Level AI/ML and Enterprise Java.
