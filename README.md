  # ⚡ DEV//QUEST: Autonomous AI University

> **🔴 LIVE SITE:** [https://xray55.github.io/dev-quest/](https://xray55.github.io/dev-quest/)

**DEV//QUEST** is a fully autonomous, self-expanding coding university. It is run by a fleet of AI agents (CrewAI) living inside a Docker container.

Unlike static tutorials, this system **researches, writes, and publishes its own curriculum 24/7**. It wakes up every morning, snapshots its database, and pushes new lessons to the public web automatically.

## 🎓 The Curriculum (Zero to Hero)

The AI Director rotates through **7 Specialized Faculties**, generating lessons that range from absolute beginner syntax to expert-level engineering.

### ☕ Java Engineering Faculty
* **Foundation:** Syntax, OOP, Collections, Polymorphism
* **Intermediate:** Streams API, File I/O, Maven/Gradle
* **Advanced:** Multithreading, Reflection, Design Patterns
* **Mastery:** Spring Boot 3, JVM Tuning (GC), Reactive Microservices

### 🎮 Game Development (C++ & C#)
* **C++ Engine Dev:** Pointers, Memory Management, Custom Allocators, Vulkan/OpenGL, ECS Architecture.
* **Unity (C#):** Coroutines, ScriptableObjects, Asset Bundles, Shader Graph, DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack).

### 🦀 Systems Programming (Rust)
* **Foundation:** Borrow Checker, Ownership, Structs & Enums
* **Intermediate:** Traits, Generics, Smart Pointers
* **Advanced:** Async (Tokio), Lifetimes, Concurrency
* **Mastery:** Unsafe Rust, FFI, Kubernetes Operators, Embedded

### 🎨 Full Stack Web Engineering
* **Frontend:** HTML/CSS, React, Tailwind, TypeScript, State Management (Redux/Zustand).
* **Backend:** Node.js Streams, Next.js (SSR/SSG), WebAssembly (WASM), Micro-Frontends.

### ⚔️ Red Team Operations (Offensive Security)
