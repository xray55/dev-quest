  # ⚡ DEV//QUEST: Autonomous AI University

> **🔴 LIVE SITE:** [https://xray55.github.io/dev-quest/](https://xray55.github.io/dev-quest/)

**DEV//QUEST** is a fully autonomous, self-expanding coding university. It is run by a fleet of AI agents (CrewAI) living inside a Docker container.

Unlike static tutorials, this system **researches, writes, and publishes its own curriculum 24/7**. It wakes up every morning, snapshots its database, and pushes new lessons to the public web automatically.

## 🎓 The Curriculum (Zero to Hero)

The AI Director rotates through **8 Specialized Faculties**, generating lessons that range from absolute beginner syntax to expert-level engineering.

### 🎨 Frontend & JavaScript Engineering
* **Foundation:** Vanilla JS Syntax, DOM Manipulation, Events.
* **Intermediate:** Closures, 'this' keyword, Prototypes, Async/Await.
* **Frameworks:** React.js, Hooks, Redux, Tailwind CSS.
* **Mastery:** Event Loop Internals, Web Workers, Browser Performance.

### ☕ Java Engineering Faculty
* **Foundation:** Syntax, OOP, Collections, Polymorphism.
* **Intermediate:** Streams API, File I/O, Maven/Gradle.
* **Mastery:** Spring Boot 3, JVM Tuning (GC), Reactive Microservices.

### 🎮 Game Development (C++ & C#)
* **C++ Engine Dev:** Pointers, Memory Management, Custom Allocators, Vulkan/OpenGL, ECS.
* **Unity (C#):** Coroutines, ScriptableObjects, Asset Bundles, Shader Graph, DOTS.

### 🦀 Systems Programming (Rust)
* **Foundation:** Borrow Checker, Ownership, Structs & Enums.
* **Intermediate:** Traits, Generics, Smart Pointers.
* **Mastery:** Unsafe Rust, FFI, Async (Tokio), Embedded.

### ⚔️ Red Team Operations (Offensive Security)
* *Powered by Uncensored AI*
* **Basics:** Python Scripting, Networking, Linux CLI.
* **Exploitation:** SQLi, XSS, Metasploit, Privilege Escalation.
* **Black Ops:** Custom Malware (C/C++), C2 Infrastructure, Buffer Overflows.

### 🛡️ Blue Team & Cyber Defense
* **Defense:** Hardening Linux/Windows, Firewalls, VPNs.
* **Analysis:** Network Traffic (Wireshark), SIEM Engineering (Splunk/ELK).
* **Response:** Digital Forensics, Memory Analysis, Threat Hunting.

### ⚙️ Backend & Distributed Systems
* **Server:** Node.js, Express/NestJS, SQL vs NoSQL.
* **Architecture:** Microservices, CAP Theorem, gRPC.
* **DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform.
## 🏗️ Architecture

The system operates on a **"Producer-Publisher"** model:
