# ⚡ DEV//QUEST: Autonomous AI University

> **🔴 LIVE SITE:** [https://xray55.github.io/dev-quest/](https://xray55.github.io/dev-quest/)

**DEV//QUEST** is a fully autonomous, self-expanding coding university. It is run by a fleet of AI agents (CrewAI) living inside a Docker container.

Unlike static tutorials, this system **researches, writes, and publishes its own curriculum 24/7**. It wakes up every morning, snapshots its database, and pushes new lessons to the public web automatically.

### ⚙️ Backend Powerhouses
* **Node.js:** Event Loop, Streams, Async Architecture
* **Django (Python):** ORM, Signals, Middleware
* **Spring Boot (Java):** Microservices, Dependency Injection
* **API Design:** GraphQL vs REST, OAuth2, JWT

### 🚀 Systems & Performance
* **Rust:** Ownership, Borrowing, Lifetimes
* **Go (Golang):** Goroutines, Channels, Concurrency
* **C++:** Memory Management, Pointers, STL
* **C#:** .NET Core, LINQ, Async/Await

### 🏢 Enterprise Solutions
